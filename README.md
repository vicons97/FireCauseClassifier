# FireCauseClassifier

I am a data enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights and driving decision-making through advanced analytics. During a class in a diploma I took in Big Data, Analysis, and Business Intelligence, I've collaborated with talented colleagues, Juanita Cortez and Lorelei Gorocica, on a compelling project focused on predicting the causes of wildfires.

# Project Overview

Our project delves into the critical question: What are the primary causes of fires? Leveraging supervised learning techniques, we trained models to classify fires based on their causes, aiming to distinguish between those caused by human activity and those caused by lightning strikes. This binary classification task required careful data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

# Key Steps in Our Journey

1.	Problem Definition: We framed the problem as a binary classification task, aiming to predict whether a fire was caused by human activity or lightning.
2.	Data Collection: We sourced our dataset from the Oregon Department of Forestry, encompassing statistical wildfire data from 2000 to 2022, including point locations and fire causes.
3.	Data Analysis: Through Pandas profiling and statistical descriptions, we gained insights into the dataset's features and distributions, paving the way for informed preprocessing decisions.
4.	Data Preprocessing: We tackled null values, performed label encoding, and selected relevant features using methods like Chi-square and mutual information.
5.	Model Training: We experimented with various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-nearest Neighbors, to find the most suitable one for our classification task.
6.	Model Evaluation and Selection: Employing cross-validation techniques and evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix, we assessed the performance of our models and iteratively refined our approach.
   
# Challenges and Iterations
Throughout our journey, we encountered several challenges, including initial model misunderstandings, incorrect feature selections, and suboptimal model choices. However, through iterative versions (V1 to V5), we refined our understanding, improved feature analysis, implemented robust preprocessing techniques, and selected models based on rigorous criteria.

# Final Thoughts

Our project represents a collaborative effort to harness the power of data and machine learning in addressing critical environmental challenges.
